# WaveSim

I wrote this project to play around with simulating waves which propagate from the postulate that successive values wish to be equal to their neighbors. This is a very simple model, but it does produce some interesting results. I wrote this code in ~2-3 hours at midnight, so don't expect anything too fancy (or anything that makes sense). (This physics is probably wrong, but it's fun to play with.) I've left a few comments that should make it a little clear what everything does.

Blue Line - Wave  
Red Line - Driven (target) value  
Orange Line - "Velocity"  
Blue-Green Line - Average of neighbors ("Acceleration")

Green lines - Â±1
